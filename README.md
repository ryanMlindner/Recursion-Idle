# Recursion-Idle

In the beginning, A coder wanted to get a job.
There were many jobs available, but no proof that this coder could actually code anything.
The coder knew how to fix this.
The coder would make a project that they enjoyed, and use handy dandy tools to show proficiency.
Totally gonna work.

# Reference for different aspects

-python connection to database: dependencies.databaseconnection and dependencies.fileaccess

-python connection to javascript and vice versa: gameengine.run (for the time being) and main.py
flask app API endpoints

-game mechanics and run function: run.js (and all other js files in static for objects) grow() 
function

-readability is okay, not where i want it to be, but the project is always changing so that
will improve over time

-project shows all the code i have ever written in javascript and html, but there is another repo
under my name for more python (technical/algorithmic) code WIP

-MVP: idle game, API endpoints/security, databasing with mongoDB, OOP style file structure, 
single authored full dev stack from server to UI (if very very small)
